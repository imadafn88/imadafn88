- 👋 Hi, I’m Aimad Sarwar.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development particularly backend.

- I enjoy messing with API endpoints , authentication calls whether using JWT tokens, OAuth, Auth2.0, getting lost in the debug warmhole.
- I enjoy data flow fetch , pull , post , update , delete operations from database.
- I enjoy reducing API data load for better performance and system efficiency and finally happy customers.
- I enjoy supabase, xata, postgres , node , express.
- Postman is my favorite tool.
- I like the modularity of React.
- Any suggestions for me getting into python or web 3.
